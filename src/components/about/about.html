                Bragging Rights was conceptualized by <strong>Amy Dalton</strong> (UX Designer)
                as a way to empower women to speak up about their achievements
                and the obstacles they faced in pursuit of their goals.
                She approached <strong>Allyson Mackay</strong>  (Product Manager) with the idea.
                Allyson incorporated agile timelines to represent the history of
                the Braggers. Amy then approached <strong>AmbyrShae Jarrell</strong>
                (Software Engineer) to be one of the first Braggers. Once Amy
                explained the idea, AmbyrShae decided to build a web app that
                could be reused for other Braggers. Thus, the three women worked
                together to make the first Bragging Session a success.
